Postprandial refers to the time after a meal. This test checks how your body processes sugar and starch after a meal. The PPBS blood test is usually done after a fasting blood sugar (FBS) test that measures blood glucose levels after fasting for 8-12 hours.

After a meal, blood sugar levels increase rapidly as the food is digested. In response, the pancreas secretes insulin - a hormone that moves glucose from the bloodstream into the body's cells to be used for energy. Thus, the blood sugar levels are controlled. However, in diabetes, your body doesn't produce enough insulin or respond effectively to insulin, so your blood sugar levels remain high.

Diabetes is a condition characterised by very high blood sugar levels. It can be classified into several types:

Type 1 Diabetes: A condition where the body's immune system attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, resulting in little or no insulin.

Type 2 Diabetes: A disorder where the body resists insulin effects or doesn't produce enough insulin.

Prediabetes: A condition where the blood sugar levels are elevated but aren't high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes.

Gestational Diabetes: Diabetes that occurs during pregnancy and usually resolves after childbirth.

The PPBS test is vital for the screening and monitoring of diabetes. Regular PPBS testing can prevent serious complications of high blood sugar, such as nerve, heart, kidney, and eye damage, and preserve overall well-being.","Also Known As Blood glucose Post prandial, Diabetes Test, Sugar Test",,,,,2024-12-03T10:18:36.903Z,,true,,,false,,,,,sc_01JDMG1MFGPD5X3D2VESYCPAMJ,2024-12-03T10:18:36.903Z,,,variant_01JE60EV0P84VXNKFJ0M62H7GN,Post Prandial Blood Sugar (PPBS),,,,,,false,false,,2024-12-03T10:18:36.951Z,,,,,,Default option,Post Prandial Blood Sugar (PPBS),,180,,prod_01JE60ETZBDJGZ6XN8BYASGRCQ,2024-12-03T10:18:36.951Z,0,,

In addition to the blood glucose test, the HbA1c test is also included in the long-term monitoring of diabetes health. The test helps measure the average blood sugar level over the past 90 days.

Routine assessment of blood sugar at home or through a laboratory test is a temporary instance. Since the blood sugar levels are subjected to constant fluctuations, it is essential to know the average blood glucose levels being maintained by your body in the blood. The HbA1c test measures the average blood sugar levels by determining the amount of glucose that is coated on haemoglobin in the red blood cells (RBCs).

The HbA1c test is a valuable aspect of the diabetes management toolkit of an individual. HbA1c levels are elevated in individuals with high blood glucose in diabetes. High HbA1c levels are also a sign of kidney disease, heart disease and nerve damage.

The Electrolytes test provides vital information that helps ensure your body's systems function properly, making it a fundamental part of routine health check-ups and the management of specific health conditions.","Also Known As ELECTROLYTES (Na+, K+, Cl) - SERUM, Na+,K+,Cl test, Sodium, Potassium, Chlorine",,,,,2024-12-03T10:32:21.656Z,,true,,,false,,,,,sc_01JDMG1MFGPD5X3D2VESYCPAMJ,2024-12-03T10:32:21.656Z,,,variant_01JE6180DVGH1T6B2TQPNZKXDS,Default variant,,,,,,false,false,,2024-12-03T10:32:21.692Z,,,,,,Default option,Default option value,,450,,prod_01JE6180CW6RXZDN4D5GXHY3CB,2024-12-03T10:32:21.692Z,0,,

Cholesterol is a fatty, wax-like substance that is essential for building healthy cells and supporting various functions in the body. However, when cholesterol levels are too elevated, it can lead to serious health issues.

This test measures your total cholesterol, which includes three key components: LDL (low-density lipoprotein, or bad cholesterol), HDL (high-density lipoprotein, or good cholesterol), and triglycerides. LDL is considered bad because it can lead to an accumulation of fat (plaque) in your arteries, narrowing them and increasing the risk of heart disease, heart attacks, or strokes. HDL is known as good cholesterol because it helps remove excess cholesterol from the blood, protecting the heart.

Doctors often order a total cholesterol test as part of a lipid profile, which assesses the overall fat levels in your blood. Having a high total cholesterol level means an increased risk for heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular problems. This makes regular cholesterol testing essential, particularly for individuals with risk factors like a poor diet, a sedentary lifestyle, or a family history of heart disease.","Also Known As Blood Cholestrol, T.

Hormones are chemical messengers that circulate in the blood and regulate the function of specific cells or organs. The primary function of prolactin is to promote the breast tissue to grow during pregnancy and produce milk after delivery. Thus, prolactin levels are normally high in pregnancy and in new mothers.

If prolactin levels increase in men and women (who are not pregnant or nursing), it can trigger the production of breast milk. In women, high prolactin levels (or hyperprolactinaemia) can affect the functioning of ovaries and lead to menstrual irregularities and infertility (inability to conceive). In men, high prolactin levels can affect the functioning of the testes and result in decreased sex drive or erectile dysfunction (inability to achieve or maintain an erection).

High prolactin levels can be caused by several conditions, such as pituitary gland disorders, hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), or even certain medications.

These include proteins, enzymes, and metabolic byproducts.

Getting an LFT test in Bangalore can help screen for various liver diseases. It can be done to check if the presenting symptoms are due to liver disease or damage. If liver disease is diagnosed, LFTs help to determine the severity of the disease. The test is useful for routine monitoring of existing liver disease and the response to ongoing treatment. LFTs are also performed to monitor the side effects of some medications known to affect the liver. LFT values can determine the presence of hepatitis (liver inflammation) and check whether it is related to alcohol intake or other causes (such as metabolic), impairment in liver function, or flow of bile (greenish-yellow fluid secreted by the liver), the site of damage (the liver itself or the bile ducts) and its extent.

This virus attacks and weakens the immune system, making it difficult for the body to fight off infections like tuberculosis and certain cancers. HIV is primarily transmitted through contact with blood or other bodily fluids of an HIV-infected person, often during unprotected sex or while sharing needles to inject drugs.

Left untreated, HIV can develop into acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the most severe stage where the immune system is severely compromised. This makes the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections and germs that do not usually harm healthy individuals but can be life-threatening in people with AIDS, and also certain cancers. HIV is classified into two main types: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is more prevalent globally than HIV-2, being more easily transmitted and more likely to progress to AIDS compared to HIV-2.

HIV usually does not cause symptoms in the early stages, so getting an HIV test may be the only way to detect the infection and start early treatment. The test may be done as a routine screening or to check for infection after a possible exposure. Early treatment can strengthen your immune system, prevent progression to AIDS, and help you avoid spreading HIV to others. HIV test may also be ordered during pregnancy. Receiving early treatment can greatly reduce the risk of spreading HIV to the baby.
